This tool takes an SVG file and set the viewBox to it exact content.

# How to build ?
This tool use premake to generate the necessary files for compiling. Just go to the folder "Platforms", peek the right "premake5" executable, and :
* for windows : premake5 vs2015
* for osx : premake5.osx gmake
* for linux : premake5.linux gmake

Then go to the "build" folder, and launch either **make** or **visual studio** from the generated files.

Of course, just drop me a line.
